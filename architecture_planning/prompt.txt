I am tasked with building an enterprise software codebase in {{ code_language_name }}.

The goals of this software project are:
<project-goals>
{{ project_goals }}
</project-goals>

I have not started to write code yet, but am in the software architecture planning phase.

Your task is as follows:
<instructions>
1. Design the high-level architecture of the project, and clearly explain it to me.

2. Only scaffold the core structure of the project. Explain what you have left out (that will need to appear in the actual implementation), and why you omitted it. 

3. Clearly illustrate a proposed project file structure.

    - Explain the purpose of each directory, and what it should or might contain

    - Explain the purpose of each important file, and what it should or might contain

    - Explain how your decisions adhere to established software design principles (modularity, maintainability, adaptability, scalability)

4. Scaffold the contents of each important file. Do not write the actual code, but rather create placeholder variables/functions/classes/interfaces (as appropriate), naming them well and documenting them appropriately.

5. Create a README.md file succintly explaining the architecture of the codebase
</instructions>
